# Vector Cascadeur Animation
Cascadeur scenes and tutorial for animation making in Cascadeur

# How to start animating
For starters, you need to download Cascadeur at their webstite (https://cascadeur.com)
And download the CSC Bridge plugin for Blender (https://github.com/arcsikex/cascadeur_bridge)

Create your account in Cascadeur, and once youre in go to Help> Claim indie license, now you can export your animations to blender
(note that this only lasts for 14 days, so when the times over, you either create a new account, or animate in blender)

# Blender part
Once your animation is done, you need to export it to blender, to do that we use the CSC Bridge.
To install it go to Blender, Edit> Preferences> Add-Ons And Install, select the zip file you downloaded.
Once youve done that, the csc bridge addon will appear, select your cascadeur executable (cascadeur.exe) and click install requirements, and youre done.

Once youve done that, click "Save settings" and import your scene, after that, you can just follow the blender animation method for exporting to bindec and etc.

Congrats! you have your Cascadeur animation.
